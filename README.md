## Summary  

Welcome to the Clus-Hierarchical-Credit-Card project! This project focuses on applying hierarchical clustering analysis to a Credit Card customers dataset to uncover valuable insights and customer segments based on their credit card usage patterns, spending behaviors, and demographics.

In summary, this project focuses on applying hierarchical clustering techniques to the Credit Card customers dataset to uncover customer segments with similar attributes and behaviors. By leveraging the insights gained from this analysis, businesses can make informed decisions to enhance their services, refine their marketing strategies, and provide a more personalized experience to their credit card customers.

## Introduction  

In today's data-driven world, understanding customer behavior and preferences is essential for businesses to thrive. The Credit Card customers dataset, available on Kaggle, offers valuable insights into the characteristics, spending patterns, and credit card usage of customers. Analyzing this dataset using hierarchical clustering techniques can provide valuable segmentation and customer profiling, enabling businesses to tailor their strategies and services to specific customer segments.  

The Credit Card customers dataset captures a wide range of features, including customer *demographics*, *credit card attributes*, and *transactional data*. By leveraging this rich dataset, we can uncover hidden structures and patterns within the customer base, leading to a deeper understanding of customer segments, preferences, and needs.

*Hierarchical clustering* is a powerful technique for grouping similar customers based on their attributes and behaviors. It constructs a hierarchical structure, known as a *dendrogram*, that reveals clusters at different levels of similarity. By utilizing a hierarchical approach, **we can identify meaningful customer segments that share common characteristics, enabling businesses to develop targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer experiences, and optimize their business strategies.**

Throughout this analysis, we will perform data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Next, we will apply hierarchical clustering algorithms to the prepared dataset, enabling us to uncover distinct customer segments based on similarities in their credit card usage patterns, spending behaviors, and demographics. By conducting hierarchical clustering on the Credit Card customers dataset, we aim to provide actionable insights to businesses in the credit card industry. The identified customer segments can assist in customer retention, acquisition strategies, personalized marketing campaigns, and the development of tailored credit card offerings. Understanding the unique needs and preferences of different customer segments can help businesses enhance customer satisfaction, increase customer loyalty, and drive business growth.

## Hierarchical Clustering - Agglomerative  

Hierarchical clustering, specifically the agglomerative approach, is a type of clustering algorithm used to group similar objects or data points based on their pairwise similarities or distances. It is a bottom-up clustering technique that starts with each data point as an individual cluster and iteratively merges clusters until a termination condition is met. We will be looking at a clustering technique, which is <b>Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering</b>. Remember that agglomerative is the bottom up approach.<br>
